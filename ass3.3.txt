Hadoop 2.x has three Components

*HDFS
*YARN
*MapReduce

HDFS: hadoop distributed file system is a java based system,it can store very large amount
of data which is of any kind without prior organization across a number of machines to enable
parallel programming

MapReduce:MapReduce is a processing technique and a program model for distributed computing 
based on java .The MapReduce algorithm contains two important tasks namely map and reduce
           
          
Map= takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data where individual elements are broken down into tuples  key/value pairs
reduce= it takes the output from a map as an input and combines those data tuples into a smaller set of tuples
As the sequence of the name MapReduce implies the reduce task is always performed after the map job

YARN:A resource management framework for scheduling and handling resource requests from distributed applications
     it is cost effective implementation
